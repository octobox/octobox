    <h2>We Care About Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      No, really, we actually do. But as a young, growing service provider it is necessary for Octobox.io to store some data. If we do so it will be for one of two reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable you to use the service effectively.</li>
      <li>To enable us to improve the services you can use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      We collect the e-mail addresses of those who sign up with Octobox.io, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect information about your GitHub notifications including some basic data about notifications from private repositories. If you install the GitHub App we collect more detailed data about these notifications including but not limitted to authors, labels, comments and status. If you enable private repository access then we collect this data for your private repositories too.
    </p>

    <h3>Transmitting Your Data</h3>
    <p>
      Transmitting information over the Internet is generally not completely secure, and we can’t guarantee the security of your data.
    </p>

    <h3>Processing And Storing Your Data</h3>
    <p>
      Your data is processed by servers in France and Ireland. Your data is stored on our servers in France, once it is stored we have processes in place to secure it.
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Your Data</h3>
    <p>
      The information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations, except to provide products or services you have requested, with your permission, or under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
      </li>
      <li>
        We transfer information about you if the assets of Octobox.io are acquired by or merged with another organisation. In this event, Octobox.io will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other than the above declarations we won’t share your information with any other organisations for marketing, market research or commercial purposes, and we don’t pass on your details to other websites.
